EffiProz references
-------------------
Currently we don't have permission to redistribute the EffiProz binaries.  To get them it's pretty simple, though, just head over to the following location:

http://effiproz.com/Downloads.aspx

And download the reference assemblies.  Place them into the appropriate subfolders to allow the code to link and compile.
